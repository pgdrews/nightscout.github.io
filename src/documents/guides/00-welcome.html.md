So you are thinking about a Nightscout rig?

## What is the Nightscout project?
Nightscout is an open source, `DIY` project.  There is no support or
any warranty of any kind.  The quality and performance of the project
is with you.

## Is this project for me?

No programming experience is required, but there are several caveats
to be aware of:

  * data may go missing without warning
  * data may be absent
  * data may be wrong
  * data may be delayed
  * you may void your warranty
  * you may break something

For all these reasons and more, it is important everyone carefully
consider whether or not this project is right for them.

Right now, the best way to prepare yourself for a project of this
nature is to follow the guidelines, to feel comfortable configuring
and installing your own rig.  Having this experience will prepare you
to get help from the entire community quickly.

There is a community on Facebook that with people from all experience
levels who will help you get up to speed on understanding and
installing.  Some may even help you experiment with new features, or
different deployment techniques.  While we love to see the diversity
and Nightscout ecosystem grow, it is important that when asking for
help, people who might provide you help need have an understanding of
how things have been set up for you.  If you departed from the
community guides, it will be harder for people to help, potentially
leaving you with less help if something breaks or needs to be
upgraded.

## What is required?

A **Dexcom receiver**, and a [**smartphone supporting USB
OTG** support](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIyBpl6Z7iM).
A special **USB OTG cable** allows the 
[smartphone to read and report Dexcom readings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_8c8d43mI8)
to the cloud.  The
[Dexcom USB port is fragile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSGF4kQj7ck)
and will break if you are not very very careful.  If you want the
uploading to work everywhere, the smartphone will need a cell data
plan.  The smartphone must support USB OTG.

The combination of the smartphone + Dexcom allows data to go to **a
website, which you** (or a friend?) **will set up and manage**.  It
will be your responsibility to make sure it continues to run.  Several
details need to be synchronized, using configuration menus in the UI
in several different applications, in order for the system to work.
The website will display the data from the cloud using a this website,
many devices will be able to access this website.

There is no privacy or security provided by these tools, all data you
upload will be publically available for anyone on the internet to
read.

So the minimum requirements for a Nightscout rig are: a website
managed by you, a smartphone, and a Dexcom.  With these components,
the CGM levels can be monitored from anywhere in the world.  The
website works on many other mobile devices, tablets, laptops; the sole
purpose is to display the data.  Due to the caveats mentioned and for
many other reasons, it is important to
[not rely on this for therapy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wqwFCjobBo) .
.

Following the step by step guides should help prepare you for putting
everything together and learning how to use the system.
